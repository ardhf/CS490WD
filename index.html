                    <p>Welcome to my portfolio website. I am a student at UMKC in my final year. I have always enjoyed programming since I've picked it up and have done many side projects. One notable project includes using an Arduino to control an LED through a website using PHP and MySQL.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my many years of school, I have become proficient in C/C++, Pyhton, and Java. My side projects have helped me learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript although I feel that I can still improve.</p>
